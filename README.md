COSMODROME
Independent Forensic Governance Analysis
COSMODROME is an independent research firm specializing in structural and governance risk assessment of decentralized protocols and staking infrastructure.
We help institutional capital see what standard audits miss.
What We Do
We analyze protocols as living systems with real political dynamics — not as static code repositories.
Traditional risk management in crypto relies on two pillars: financial audit (balance verification) and smart contract audit (code vulnerability scanning). Neither answers the critical question: who actually controls the protocol, and what happens when things go wrong?
COSMODROME provides the missing third layer: Governance Due Diligence (GDD).
Methodology
Our assessments are built on the Forensic Integrity Framework (FIF v3.2) — a structured methodology for evaluating governance concentration, exit feasibility, and infrastructure resilience in decentralized systems.
Core assessment dimensions:

Voting Power Distribution — real influence mapping beyond public dashboards
Execution Risk — how quickly and unilaterally can protocol parameters be changed
Exit Feasibility — whether investor protection mechanisms are enforceable under stress
Infrastructure Resilience — validator concentration, jurisdictional dependencies, single points of failure

Each assessment produces a structured verdict: Grade A, Grade B, or lower — an evidence-based rating grounded in primary sources: on-chain data, governance proposals, voting records, and protocol documentation.

Conflict of Interest Policy
Our model: the analysis is paid for by whoever is buying the asset, not by whoever issued it. This is the only configuration that eliminates conflict of interest.
COSMODROME does not accept payment from protocols under assessment. We do not hold governance tokens of protocols we analyze during the assessment period.
Source Verification
All COSMODROME reports use exclusively Grade A and Grade B sources:

Grade A: On-chain data, smart contract code, governance proposals, official protocol documentation, SEC/regulatory filings
Grade B: Protocol team public statements, verified third-party analytics (Dune, DefiLlama), audited financial reports, peer-reviewed research

Reports include SHA-256 document hashes for forensic-grade evidence integrity.
