# COSMODROME

**Independent Forensic Governance Analysis**

COSMODROME is an independent research firm specializing in structural and governance risk assessment of decentralized protocols and staking infrastructure. We help institutional capital see what standard audits miss.

## What We Do

We analyze protocols as living systems with real political dynamics — not as static code repositories.

Traditional risk management in crypto relies on two pillars: financial audits and smart contract security reviews. Both are necessary. Neither is sufficient.

COSMODROME adds the missing layer: **governance forensics** — systematic analysis of who actually controls a protocol, how power is distributed, and what happens when that power is tested.
