# COSMODROME — Forensic Governance Research

> We find what audits don't look for.

Traditional risk management in crypto relies on two pillars: financial audits and smart contract reviews. Both are necessary. Neither is sufficient.

COSMODROME adds the missing layer: governance forensics — systematic analysis of who actually controls a protocol, how power is distributed, and what happens when that power is tested.

## Methodology

- **ECI (Effective Coordination Index)** — framework for scoring governance centralization, coordination barriers, and exit feasibility.
- **GitHub Forensic Layer v2.0** — 19 evidence categories across 3 analysis modes (Structural, Temporal, Contradiction) for assessing de-facto technical sovereignty through development governance. Includes 4 composite metrics (GCM, GCDS, POCI, GMI), mandatory reporting standard with Signal/Interpretation/Benign separation, and Red Flag Escalation Protocol.

## Active Cases

| Case | Protocol | Archetype | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| #005 | [Lido](cases/005-lido/) | Corporate-backed → Hybrid | In Progress — public evidence layer published |

## Who This Is For

- Institutional investors evaluating DeFi protocol governance risk
- Fund managers conducting due diligence on token holdings
- Risk committees assessing exposure to governance concentration
- Researchers studying decentralization claims vs. operational reality

## What We Publish vs. What We Don't

**Public (this repository):** Methodology, anonymized evidence signals, investigation scope and gaps.

**Client-only (under engagement):** Identity mapping, on-chain overlap analysis, scored reports, governance latency forensics, foundation infrastructure control assessment.
