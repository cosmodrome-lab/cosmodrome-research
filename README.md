# COSMODROME

**Independent Forensic Governance Analysis**

COSMODROME is an independent research firm specializing in structural and governance risk assessment of decentralized protocols and staking infrastructure. We help institutional capital see what standard audits miss.

---

## What We Do

We analyze protocols as living systems with real political dynamics — not as static code repositories.

Traditional risk management in crypto relies on two pillars: financial audits and smart contract security reviews. Both are necessary. Neither is sufficient.

COSMODROME adds the missing layer: **governance forensics** — systematic analysis of who actually controls a protocol, how power is distributed, and what happens when that power is tested.

## Methodology

- **ECI (Effective Coordination Index)** — framework for scoring governance centralization, coordination barriers, and exit feasibility.
- **GitHub Forensic Layer** — 18 evidence categories across 3 analysis modes (Structural, Temporal, Contradiction) for assessing de-facto technical sovereignty through development governance evidence. Includes composite metrics: GCM, GCDS, POCI, GMI.

## Active Cases

| Case | Protocol | Focus | Status |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| #005 | Lido | Dual Governance, DSM control, development centralization | In Progress |

## Who This Is For

- Family offices and institutional allocators evaluating DeFi exposure
- Governance researchers studying power concentration
- Protocol teams seeking independent governance assessment
- Risk committees requiring evidence-based governance reports
