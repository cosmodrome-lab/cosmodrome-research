# COSMODROME — Case Studies

Forensic governance assessments of specific protocols.

Each case applies the COSMODROME methodology (ECI + GitHub Forensic Layer) to produce evidence-based governance risk reports.

## Active Cases

| Case | Protocol | Archetype | Focus | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| #005 | Lido | Corporate-backed → Hybrid | Dual Governance, DSM control, development centralization, LDO vs code divergence | In Progress |

## Planned

| Case | Protocol | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| #006 | MakerDAO / Sky | ESM history, spell scripts, governance contract mutations |
| #007 | Optimism | Security council, upgrade authority, foundation vs DAO boundary |
| #008 | Arbitrum | Nitro upgrade governance, security council tooling |

## Case Structure

Each case folder contains:

- `audit-checklist.md` — GitHub Forensic Layer checklist with preliminary scores
- `evidence/` — raw data, API outputs, screenshots (added during investigation)
- `report.md` — final forensic report (added upon completion)
