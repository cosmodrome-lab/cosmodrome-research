COSMODROME Case Registry
Published Cases
Case #001 — Arbitrum: Emergency Governance Assessment

Focus: Security Council authority structure, emergency powers scope, election mechanism
Model: Distributed individual authority — 9/12 multisig threshold
Key Finding: Broad emergency mandate concentrated in elected council; accountability exists through semi-annual elections but operational scope allows significant unilateral action
Framework Applied: FIF v3.2, ECI v1.0

Case #002 — Optimism: Emergency Governance Assessment

Focus: Optimism Foundation emergency powers, Guardian role, centralized override mechanisms
Model: Centralized entity control — single foundation holds emergency authority
Key Finding: Emergency powers reside with Optimism Foundation with no on-chain stakeholder override mechanism; governance decentralization roadmap exists but current structure is centralized
Framework Applied: FIF v3.2, ECI v1.0

Case #003 — Maker / Sky: Emergency Governance Assessment

Focus: Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM), MKR threshold analysis, governance attack surface
Model: Plutocratic capital threshold — 150,000 MKR required for emergency action
Key Finding: ESM activation requires approximately $1.87B in MKR at current prices; effectively inaccessible to all but the largest holders; creates asymmetric governance where emergency protection exists in code but not in practice
Framework Applied: FIF v3.2, ECI v1.0

Lido — Dual Governance Forensic Assessment

Focus: Dual Governance mechanism, stETH withdrawal coordination, Rage Quit feasibility, validator concentration
Key Finding: Declared investor protection (Rage Quit) requires coordination across fragmented stETH holder base with capital barriers that render the mechanism structurally impaired under realistic conditions
Framework Applied: FIF v3.2, ECI v1.0
